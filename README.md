# Landing Page - Video Editor AI

This is a landing page project for an AI video editor, developed using React and Tailwind CSS. The design was inspired by the GitHub repository and YouTube tutorial by [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies. **Make sure to include the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag**, as `react-slideshow` is not yet compatible with React 18:

   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
