# Landing Page - Video Editor AI

This is a landing page project for an AI video editor, developed using React and Tailwind CSS. The design was inspired by the GitHub repository and YouTube tutorial by [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin).

## Project Objective
Enhance my front-end development skills by deepening my understanding of React Hooks and improving my proficiency in Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies. **Make sure to include the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag**, as `react-slideshow` is not yet compatible with React 18:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code files of the application.
- `public/`: Contains public files such as `index.html`.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by improving or fixing issues in the project. Just create a fork of this repository and submit a pull request.

## Additional Resources I Made
- Some padding and margin fixes, still missing some improvements
- minimal change in header size and transition to Nav - Mobile 
- Change in the size of some icons
- Still missing some responsiveness adjustments
